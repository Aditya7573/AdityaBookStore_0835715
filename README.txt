Hello Sir, this me again in the new assignment of asp.net assignment 2 
which is just 5% so i hope i will get it done in 10-8hrs max lets hope.

so in this assignment the catch is we have all the things that we need to do which is provided by you sir in the pptx form 
and we just need to follow those steps.

in the last assignment was not able to do it in ym mac i will first try to do the thing in mac if it won't run in it then as assignment 1 we
go in the computer lab and do this thing.but i dont think is gonna work so we will head toowards src lab.......

First of all we have to create and mvc core web app in which we will do the following steps that were displayed clearly in the pptx 
that we will name the applicatioN "AdityaBookStore"

in which we change the authentication to individual able the runtime compilation 

looked at all the files as sir describided in the pptx and also looked at every folder to be familiar with it and also run the application 
and this time theres a new new thing that we have seen was the registr and login information in the right side top 

now we will change the line in the startup.cs file as described in the presentation.

Created the git hub respoartatriy which is private one i dont know why but i think we will do same and excat thing as it was described in the pptx. did that and named the Resporatitory : AdityabookStore_0835715.

Added the Break points in the index and privacy and also checked it it was running as it was supposed to 

in the bootstrapwatch.com i have to choose the theme for my website and CHOOSEN THE lux theme and downloaded the bootstrap.css

replace the bootstrap.css file with the new one which located in the wwwrooot folder and replace one more file from the sir provided in the 
site.css file in the assignment-2 folder.

linked properly in the _layout.cshtml file by replacing in the file name from bootstrap.min.css to bootstrap.css

in the two files called _layout.cshtml and _loginPartial.cshtml and changed the lines as describeded in the pptx like we have to remove from some place the dark-nav and add some content in the footer and all did it and all runned the application and it looks nice 
as the lux theme should look like.....

Added the Addition stylesheet and javascript links in the _layout.cshtml by adding the css links in the top and javascript link in the bootom and also we will add the dropdown menu with code in the layout.cshtml file right now its just a dummy

but maybe will add in the future and make it working right now is working but just as a look wise not the funcatnality i guess.

Now we will create a a three new projects named as AdityaBooks.Models , AdityaBooks.utilty and AdityaBook.DataAccess and all will be created in the 3.1net core not in the 5.0 core which is created in the main project.

we will copy the data folder in the dataAcess prject and deleter the original one and then installed the microsoft.entity and sqlserver and Relational with the help of pmc commad line and then we will delete the migration file. totallly hope it runns still,because i changed too much......

install the pacakage.identity.entity.framework....

also one more thing i missed in the pervious step because of which my error were not gonna after installing package we have to add the itemgroup in the DataAccess.csproj file.

and now we will modifiy the name space in the data.cs file from AdityaBookStore.Data to AdityaBookStore.DataAccess.Data

After that deleted the all Class1.cs file from all three project.

move the models folder into the model project
