Built on the robust foundation of ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 5) and ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, this dynamic application seamlessly incorporates Dependency Injection, 
Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server to execute versatile CRUD operations. The primary focus lies in facilitating an efficient online bulk book ordering system
with attractive discounts for both individual users and companies. The MVC design pattern ensures a structured approach, while the integration of Entity Framework
Core streamlines database interactions. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes the implementation of features such as social media authentication through
Facebook and Google accounts, providing users with a convenient and secure login experience. As the application evolves, additional functionalities are planned
to enhance the overall user experience, making it a comprehensive solution for online book procurement.
